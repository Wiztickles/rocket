				<h2>The Moon</h2>
					<h3>Why It Shines During Night</h3>
					<p>On most nights, you can see the moon in the sky. Sometimes it’s very bright, large and round. At other times, you might see only a tiny sliver of it or clouds might cover it. For thousands of years, people have watched the moon and told stories about it.</p>
					<h3>Information</h3>
					<p>The Moon was probably made 4.5 billion years ago when a large object hit the Earth and blasted out rocks that came together to orbit round the Earth.  They eventually melted together, cooled down and became the Moon.  For another 500 million years pieces of rock kept striking aginst the surface of the Moon. </p>
					<p>You can see the surface of the Moon by using a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.  The Moon’s surface shows the damage caused by these large pieces of rock hitting it billions of years ago.  The surface is covered in craters, pits and scars</p>
					<p>If you look at the Moon when it is nearly full you can see the dark areas which are known as the seas. (They are all given Latin names, such as Mare Serenitatis – the Sea of Serenity, or Mare Frigoris – the Sea of Cold).These are not really seas but are huge expanses of smooth dark lava.   </p>
					<h3>How hot and cold does it get on the moon?</h3>
					<p>As you may have learned, the moon doesn't have any air around it. The air that surrounds our earth acts as a nice blanket to keep us warm and comfy! But the moon, since it doesn't have this blanket, gets much colder than the earth — and much hotter than the earth. On the side of the moon that the sun is shining on, the temperature reaches 260°Fahrenheit! That is hotter than boiling. On the dark side of the moon, it gets very cold, -280° Fahrenheit.</p>
					<h3>What is a lunar eclipse? What is a solar eclipse?</h3>
					<p>Anytime there are three bodies (the sun, the moon, or planet) lined up so that one blocks the light from another, we call that an eclipse. During a solar eclipse, our moon moves between us (on Earth) and the sun and blocks the sunlight. During a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks the sun's light that normally lights up the moon. Since we are standing on Earth, what we see is that the moon gets dark. Other kinds of eclipses happen too. For instance if you were standing on the surface of Jupiter (kind of hard, but we can imagine) you might see one of its moons eclipse the sun!</p>
					<h3>Fun Facts about Our Moon</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>On Earth, we have an atmosphere, or blanket of gas and liquid, that protects our planet from comets and meteors. The moon has no atmosphere so meteors often crash into it. The moon is covered with craters from these collisions. It also has about 2 inches of dust on its surface. This dust probably falls from space and also comes from the crashes.</li>
						<li>The moon creates the Earth’s tides. On the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon, the moon’s gravity pulls the waters of the oceans up slightly, resulting in high tide.</li>
